# Basic Profiling for Research Code

## Description

Have you ever run a piece of analysis code and wondered why it takes so long?
Without measuring where time is spent, it’s easy to guess and optimize the
wrong part of your code.

In this free webinar, we’ll introduce lightweight profiling tools that help
identify performance bottlenecks. You’ll see how to use **%timeit** and
**%prun** in Jupyter, as well as Python’s `cProfile` for scripts, to measure
where time is spent and make evidence-based improvements.

## Agenda

- Why do we measure performance?
- What are the levels in which we measure performance?
- How do we measure performance?
- What do we do when our programs run slow?
